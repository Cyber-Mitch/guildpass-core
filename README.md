## Contracts (Solidity / Foundry)

The `MembershipNFT` is a simple ERC-721 with expiry and suspension semantics, and admin-controlled mint/renew. It supports **multi-community memberships**, meaning a single deployed contract can represent memberships across multiple communities via the `communityId` mapping. Events emitted are suitable for off-chain indexing and include the associated `communityId` to easily map to the backend state.

```bash
# Build contracts
npm run contracts:build   # runs: forge build

# Test contracts
npm run contracts:test    # runs: forge test

# Deploy (example script)
npm run contracts:deploy  # runs: forge script contracts/script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast
```

After deploying, set `MEMBERSHIP_NFT_ADDRESS` and `CHAIN_ID` in `.env`.

## API Versioning & Compatibility

The GuildPass Access API follows a strict versioning and compatibility contract for all `/v1` routes:

- **Version Header**: All API responses include an `x-guildpass-api-version` header (e.g., `1.0.0`) indicating the version being served.
- **Server Version**: The `GET /health/live` endpoint exposes the current server API version.
- **Backwards Compatibility**: We commit to maintaining backwards compatibility for all `/v1` routes. We will not remove fields from responses or require new mandatory request parameters without bumping the major API version (e.g., to `/v2`).
- **Deprecation**: If a `/v1` route or field needs to be deprecated, we will serve a `deprecation: true` header on those responses and provide guidance in our documentation. Deprecated endpoints will continue to function for a minimum sunset period before removal. Clients are encouraged to monitor the `deprecation` header.

---

## API Endpoints (MVP)

| Method | Path | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| GET | `/v1/memberships/:wallet` | Membership status summary by wallet |
| GET | `/v1/members/:wallet` | Member profile (with membership and roles) |
| POST | `/v1/access/check` | Access decision for `{ wallet, communityId, resource }` |
| GET | `/v1/communities/:communityId/members` | Admin member listing |

Responses include `allowed`/`denied` plus human-readable and machine-readable reasons.

---

## OpenAPI Specification

A stable, machine-readable OpenAPI specification is generated for all public API routes to support SDKs and integrations.

- **Specification File:** [docs/openapi.json](./docs/openapi.json)

**For Contributors:**
When adding or modifying routes in the Access API, you must update the checked-in specification. Run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
npm run -w access-api openapi:generate
```

CI will automatically verify that the OpenAPI specification is up-to-date with your code changes.

---

## Data Model

Prisma schema includes: `communities`, `wallets`, `members`, `memberships`, `roles`, `access policies`, `profiles`, `badges` (placeholder), `audit_events`, and `outbox_events`.

---

## Integration Event Outbox

The API uses the **transactional outbox pattern** to emit reliable integration events when domain state changes. Every mutation that affects memberships, roles, policies, resources, or access decisions writes a durable event to the `OutboxEvent` table within the same database transaction as the state change. This guarantees that no event is lost on request failure or process restart.

### Outbox Processing Contract

| Concept | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Event creation** | Events are written atomically with the domain mutation inside a Prisma `$transaction`. If the mutation fails, no event is created. If the event write fails, the entire transaction rolls back. |
| **Event types** | `MEMBERSHIP_CREATED`, `MEMBERSHIP_UPDATED`, `MEMBERSHIP_DELETED`, `ROLE_ASSIGNED`, `ROLE_REMOVED`, `RESOURCE_CREATED`, `RESOURCE_UPDATED`, `RESOURCE_ARCHIVED`, `POLICY_CREATED`, `POLICY_UPDATED`, `POLICY_DELETED`, `ACCESS_DECISION` |
| **Statuses** | `pending` (awaiting delivery), `delivered` (successfully processed), `failed` (permanently failed after max retries) |
| **Retry strategy** | Exponential backoff: `nextRetryAt = now + 10 × 2^retryCount` seconds. Default max 5 retries. |
| **Delivery worker** | `outboxWorker` polls for pending events every `OUTBOX_WORKER_INTERVAL_MS` (default 10s) and delegates to a pluggable handler. The default handler is a no-op logger. |
| **Pruning** | Delivered events older than 7 days are automatically pruned to prevent unbounded table growth. |

### Configuration

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
| -------------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `OUTBOX_WORKER_INTERVAL_MS` | `10000` | Polling interval for the outbox worker (ms) |
| `OUTBOX_WORKER_BATCH_SIZE` | `50` | Max events processed per worker pass |

### Pluggable Handler

The outbox worker accepts a custom `OutboxEventHandler` function. Replace the default no-op with your own delivery logic (HTTP webhook, NATS, Kafka, analytics pipeline, etc.):

```typescript
import { createOutboxWorker, OutboxEventHandler } from './workers/outboxWorker';

const myHandler: OutboxEventHandler = async (event) => {
  await fetch('https://hooks.example.com/integration', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(event),
  });
};

const worker = createOutboxWorker(10_000, myHandler);
worker.start();
```

### Observability

| Metric | Type | Labels |
| ------ | ---- | ------ |
| `outbox_events_created_total` | Counter | `event_type` |
| `outbox_events_delivered_total` | Counter | `event_type` |
| `outbox_events_failed_total` | Counter | `event_type` |

---

## Policy Engine

Simple rules: `PUBLIC`, `MEMBERS_ONLY`, `ADMINS_ONLY`, `CONTRIBUTORS_OR_ADMINS`.

Role resolution combines:
- Membership state (adds `member` role when active)
- Backend role assignments
- Room for future manual override rules (TODO)

**Full spec** (policy semantics, exact role-resolution algorithm, precedence between membership-derived and backend-assigned roles, worked examples): [`packages/policy-engine/README.md`](./packages/policy-engine/README.md).

---

## Testing

```bash
# All tests across workspaces
npm run test

# Policy engine unit tests
npm run -w @guildpass/policy-engine test

# Access API unit and integration tests
npm run -w access-api test

# Contract tests (Foundry)
npm run contracts:test

# TypeScript type checking
npm run typecheck
```

### Prisma migration checks

When you change the Prisma schema or migration history, validate the database workflow locally before opening a pull request:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
createdb guildpass_test
createdb guildpass_shadow
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/guildpass_test \
SHADOW_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/guildpass_shadow \
pnpm --filter access-api prisma:validate
pnpm --filter access-api prisma:generate
pnpm --filter access-api prisma:migrate:deploy
pnpm --filter access-api prisma:migrate:check
```

The CI workflow runs the same validation steps against a disposable PostgreSQL service and a shadow database so drift is caught before merge.

Not every schema change is safe to ship as a single direct migration —
see [CONTRIBUTING.md > Database Migrations: Direct vs. Expand/Contract](./CONTRIBUTING.md#database-migrations-direct-vs-expandcontract)
for the decision framework, a worked example, and the reusable
batched-backfill utility (`apps/access-api/src/services/backfillService.ts`)
for populating large tables without holding long-running locks.

### Integration Testing

The **Membership Integration Test** (`apps/access-api/src/membership-integration.test.ts`) validates the complete flow from MembershipNFT contract events to API access decisions:

- **Contract Events** → Database State → Policy Engine → API Response
- Tests event ingestion (MembershipMinted, MembershipRenewed, MembershipSuspended)
- Validates active, expired, and suspended membership scenarios
- Proves access control decisions reflect actual membership state
- Can run locally without a live blockchain

See [apps/access-api/INTEGRATION_TEST_GUIDE.md](./apps/access-api/INTEGRATION_TEST_GUIDE.md) for detailed documentation.

## Deferred Areas (Intentionally Not Implemented)

- Advanced governance permissions
- Constitutional rule engine
- Complex moderation workflows / appeals / reinstatement
- Rich reward distribution and advanced streak logic
- Contribution scoring engine
- Full event attendance ingestion
- Multi-chain support (current: EVM only)
- Advanced indexing pipeline

Clear interfaces and TODOs are left where appropriate.

---

## Development Notes

- Business logic lives in services and the policy engine, not route handlers.
- Contracts and API are aligned via shared types and simple event ABI.
- The code aims to be small and understandable; extending should not require rewrites.
