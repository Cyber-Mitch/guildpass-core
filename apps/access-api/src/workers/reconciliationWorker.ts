/**
 * reconciliationWorker.ts
 *
 * Periodically scans memberships whose stored state is `active` but whose
 * `expiresAt` has passed, and updates them to `expired`.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - Idempotent: only updates records where state != 'expired' AND expiresAt < now.
 * - Emits one MEMBERSHIP_RECONCILED audit event per changed record.
 * - Does NOT touch `suspended` memberships whose expiry has passed; those are
 *   included intentionally so they can be expired as well.
 * - Read-time expiry checks in memberService remain the first line of defence.
